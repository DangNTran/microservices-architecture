# microservices-architecture


## It's time to move knowledge from OneNotes and my head to Github! This would be a great chance for practicing on writting and consolidating my knowledge.

### The content comes from:
+ My experience when learning from practical proect which shifted from monolith achitecture to microservice architectures.
+ Book by Sam Newman - Building Microservices: Designing Fine-Grained Systems
+ Book by Susan J. Fowler - Production-Ready Microservices: Building Standardized Systems Across an Engineering Organization
+ Book by Eric Evans - Domain-driven design
+ Documentation of tools, libraries and platforms such as AWS, Kafka, Eureka, Redis, Etcd, Zuul, Zookeeper.
